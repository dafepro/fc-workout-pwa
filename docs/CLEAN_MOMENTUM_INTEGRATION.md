# Clean Momentum integration

## Baseline

This branch starts from `origin/main` at `13294d5`. The development reference is
`codex/momentum-concept-tightening` at `871e462`; its commit history is not
merged or cherry-picked.

## Product boundary

The integrated player application has one Today, Team, and Me experience.
Classic Alpha, Momentum Alpha, the Momentum concept route, Leaders, and the old
Team Canvas application do not ship as routes or selectable experiences.

The Canvas-based Team Lounge developed as V2 is the sole lounge going forward.
It is renamed to Team Lounge during integration. The old renderer, persistence,
transport, paths, and V1/V2 selector are removed rather than retained as a
fallback.

Production builds include the canonical Team Lounge but omit developer panels,
collision overlays, forced states, fixture controls, and diagnostic UI. The
production profile is the default; only the disposable-dev workflow explicitly
enables the development profile.

## Safety corrections

- Training check-ins keep predefined outcomes, effort, and tiredness. They do
  not add private free-text notes.
- Team Rewards use predefined reward content and approved bundled artwork, not
  staff-authored player-facing text or uploaded images.
- Plan publication remains development-only until its numeric workload bounds
  receive coaching/content-owner approval.
- Connected production fails closed when its backend is unavailable.

## Schema direction

Main migrations `000001` through `000013` remain unchanged. Experimental
migrations are replaced by final, feature-coherent migrations for training and
Momentum, Prize Boxes and inventory, Team Rewards, and Team Lounge. A populated
main-schema migration test and a clean-database migration test are both release
gates.

## Delivery order

1. Establish build-profile and production-artifact boundaries.
2. Build the consolidated Today, Team, and Me shell without alternate routes.
3. Integrate authoritative Momentum, plans, and structured check-ins.
4. Integrate Prize Boxes, final avatar inventory, and Team Rewards.
5. Promote the Canvas-based lounge as the only Team Lounge.
6. Add final migrations, backup coverage, connected E2E, and clean dev
   destroy/create evidence.

Each step is test-first and small enough to review independently.

## Completed slices

- Focused Today logging: moved additional-session entry into completed Today,
  removed the global floating action, and updated connected workflow coverage.
- Canonical route surface: removed the Leaders player route and its UI while
  retaining safe historical reaction rendering and backend compatibility.
- Developer route packaging: suffixed dev-only pages explicitly and configured
  route discovery so production omits them while development still ships them.
- Momentum projection core: ported the authoritative diminishing daily credit,
  56-day fade, planned-rest, score cap, and current check-in streak rules.
- Connected Momentum summary: exposed score and check-in streak from existing
  non-deleted, team-local activity entries; planned-rest wiring awaits final schema.
